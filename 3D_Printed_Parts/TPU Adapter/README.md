# B2X300 - TPU Adapter

This is a improved extruder filament guider for the **B2X300** 3D printer.
It is recommended to use this part when printing with TPU/Nylon filaments as they reduce the likeliness of filament escaping after the extruder's traction wheel.

For your **B2X300**, we recommend you print both the adapters, one for each extruder.

---

## Printing Settings
You should print the TPU adapter in a rigid material that can whitstand at least 70ÂºC, for example PETG/ASA with the following settings:
- Layer height: 0.1mm
- Outer walls: 4
- Infill density: 30%

The estimated printing time is around `04h 01m`.

> Please note that you might need to change the orientation of some parts so they can print with correctly. Please check below for the recommended orientation.
