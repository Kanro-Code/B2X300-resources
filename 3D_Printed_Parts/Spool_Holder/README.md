# B2X300 - Spool Holder

This is the recommended spool holder for your **B2X300** 3D printer.
It is recommended for spools from 330 g up to 2 Kg and for spools ranging from 35mm to 120mm wide.

For your **B2X300**, we recommend you print 2 spool holders, one for each extruder.

## Printing Settings
You should print the spool holder in a rigid material with the following settings:
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Outer walls: 3
- Infill density: 15%

The estimated printing time is around `7h 30m`.

> Please note that you might need to change the orientation of some parts so they can print with correctly. Please check below for the recommended orientation.
