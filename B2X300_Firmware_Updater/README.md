# B2X300 - Firmware Updating Tool

The firmware for your B2X300 is a custom flavor of Marlin (http://marlinfw.org/) and it is regularly being updated by our team, either by adding new features or by squashing some bugs.

You should update your 3D printer often to take advantage of the latest developments. To help you with that task, BEEVERYCREATIVE developed a tool to quickly download the latest version of our firmware and upload it to your 3D printer.

You can find compiled versions for Windows, macOS and Linux. The update process is pretty straight forward: just power on your printer, connect it to the computer and follow the instructions on the app.

## If the printer cannot be found during the update procedure, ensure the USB cable is connected and the printer enabled, then install the driver for your platform available on the "USB driver" folder
